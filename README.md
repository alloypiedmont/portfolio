## Hello and Welcome!
It can be challenging to get to know someone through a resume or portfolio alone, so I'd like to take a moment to introduce myself. I'm a college graduate with a diverse 5-year career exploring where I fit best in the professional world. With a variety of experiences under my belt, I’m eager to find a long-term role that aligns with my passions.

I’m a curious and hardworking individual with a deep interest in public health and wildlife biology. One of my favorite books is "The Hot Zone" by Richard Preston. While it’s a dramatized account of the 1981 Ebola outbreak and has stirred debate within epidemiology circles, it sparked my fascination with the exciting and impactful field of public health.

I also have a love for the great outdoors. For a long time, I aspired to be a herpetologist—a scientist who studies reptiles and amphibians. This passion led me to work with endangered frogs in California, a truly rewarding experience. On my days off, you’ll often find me exploring caves, rock climbing, backpacking, or canoeing down nearby rivers.

Recently, I’ve developed a strong passion for analytics and data storytelling. This focus blends my natural curiosity and problem-solving skills, enabling me to uncover meaningful insights and support impactful decision-making. As a research technician, I was often responsible for collecting data that others analyzed—only recently did I discover how rewarding it is to be the one interpreting the data! I’m excited to leverage this newfound enthusiasm in a career where I can use data to drive meaningful change, whether in public health, environmental science, or beyond.
